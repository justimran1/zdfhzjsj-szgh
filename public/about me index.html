        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is IMRAN  and I'm a Computer Science student at <a href="https://www.lasu.edu.ng">Lagos State University</a> University. I have a passion for coding and web development. I'm proficient in several programming languages including Java, Python, and JavaScript. I also have experience with various frameworks such as React.js and Django.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and exploring new technologies. I believe that continuous learning is key in the field of Computer Science. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from coding, I love photography and traveling. Capturing moments and exploring new places allows me to look at life from different perspectives. I believe that these hobbies not only enrich my personal life but also enhance my creativity and problem-solving skills in my professional life.
